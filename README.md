## Features in Detail
1. Player Performance Analysis
View statistics of individual players, including runs, wickets, batting and bowling averages, and more.
Filter by match type (e.g., Semi-Final, Final) and opponent teams.
2. Team Performance Comparison
Compare the performance of different IPL teams.
Visualize total runs, wickets, and other performance metrics for teams over multiple seasons.
3. Interactive Visualizations
Use matplotlib and seaborn to visualize:
Batting and bowling averages for players.
Runs scored per match and player contribution over the years.
Performance trends for teams.
4. Custom Filters
Filter matches by:
Player name (e.g., Virat Kohli's performance).
Match type (e.g., Finals, Semi-Finals).
Date range and opponent teams.
5. Custom Queries and Insights
Users can input custom queries (using Streamlit’s st.text_input or st.selectbox) to extract specific data from the IPL dataset and analyze it.
Data Source
The IPL dataset used in this app contains match-by-match details for each IPL season. It includes information like:

Match ID
Player names
Runs scored
Wickets taken
Match type (e.g., league, semi-final, final)
Teams playing and more.
The dataset can be sourced from various public sources like:
